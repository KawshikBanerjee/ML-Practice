# Find Movie Similarity from Plot Summaries

In this project from [Datacamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/648), NLP techniques are used to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia. These techniques include:
- Tokenization
- Stemming
- TF-IDF vectorizer
- K-means and clustering
- Cosine similarity

The dataset contains the titles of the top 100 movies on IMDb as well as each movie's plot summary from both IMDb and Wikipedia.
