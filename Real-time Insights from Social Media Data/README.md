# Real-time Insights from Social Media Data

Fear of missing out, curiosity, self-esteem, speed: it's like social media has changed our basic human needs; these baits are keeping us hooked and engaged. And [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) is a master at this game. [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk)'s tweets keep Wall Street on its toes; [Trump](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr)'s tweets have the potential of starting wars â€” Twitter has this huge influence on the world because of the type of its users. Data from Twitter-storms is available in near real-time. This means we can learn about the big waves of thoughts and moods around the world as they arise. So of course, we are not going to miss the chance to analyze this treasure trove.

In this project from [Datacamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/760), JSON formatted datasets are used to understand the nuts and bolts of Twitter data. In particular: current (at the time of creating the dataset) hot-trend in the Twitter feed.

*Warning: Some of the tweets in the Twitter datasets might contain explicit language.*
