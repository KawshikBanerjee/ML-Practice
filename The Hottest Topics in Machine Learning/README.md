# The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking works are published. In this project from [Datacamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/158), a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade is analyzed to discover the latest trends in machine learning. [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf?TB_iframe=true&width=370.8&height=658.8) is used to find the most significant topics in the dataset.
